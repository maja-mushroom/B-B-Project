# B&B application testing

This is the final project, and the tasks we had to do are the following:
Create your own repository on githab - invite Enisa "ExtremeSoftwareGroup" in the repository
Work on parts of tasks in special branches and do PR on the main
Create a folder structure for storing keywords, automatic tests, manual tests, bugs, folder for this task description, test plan, test report (test plan / report can have several versions as you go with work, and save each version in a separate file eg test_plan_1_13Apr21 You can write the plan / report in Word / Excel or simply in a regular .txt file)
Create a Read.me file and refine it if necessary - make sure that the content is modeled on serious projects and that it describes what you have in the repository
Write a Test plan for testing the application (for the UI part you can use the online application and admin, and for the API part you need to go through the Readme files in the folders on the repository as explained in the main readme file of the repository)
Write as many manual tests as possible and prioritize them (UI, API)
Write about 10 bugs (if there are no real defects, invent a discrepancy with the requirements)
Write automated tests for APIs
Write automated UI tests for those manual tests that you have marked as smoke tests or priority1
Perform manual and automatic tests, and make a Test report based on that and other data
